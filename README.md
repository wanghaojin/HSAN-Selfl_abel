### Overview

<p align = "justify"> 
We propose a novel contrastive deep graph clustering method dubbed Hard Sample Aware Network (HSAN) by introducing a comprehensive similarity measure criterion and a general dynamic sample weighing strategy. Concretely, in our algorithm, the similarities between samples are calculated by considering both the attribute embeddings and the structure embeddings, better-revealing sample relationships and assisting hardness measurement. Moreover, under the guidance of the carefully collected high-confidence clustering information, our proposed weight modulating function will first recognize the positive and negative samples and then dynamically up-weight the hard sample pairs while down-weighting the easy ones. In this way, our method can mine not only the hard negative samples but also the hard positive sample.

### Requirements

The proposed HSAN is implemented with python 3.7 on a NVIDIA 3090 GPU. 

Python package information is summarized in **requirements.txt**:

- torch==1.7.1
- tqdm==4.59.0
- numpy==1.19.2
- munkres==1.1.4
- scikit_learn==1.2.0



### Quick Start

- Step1: use the **cora.zip** file or download other datasets from  [Awesome Deep Graph Clustering/Benchmark Datasets](https://github.com/yueliu1999/Awesome-Deep-Graph-Clustering#datasets-details) 

- Step2: unzip the dataset into the **./dataset** folder

- Step3: run

  ```
  python train.py
  ```

  the clustering results will be recorded in the **./results.csv** file
